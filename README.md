# Quantum Gate 
Quantum Gate unlocks EVM utilities on BTC Ordinals inscriptions. This is an ETH Global SF Hackathon 2024 project.

## How it works
1. This app is an BTC inscription (to be inscribed soon). This inscription lives on the BTC blockchain.
2. A user visits the inscription page hosted by any BTC Ordinals explorer such as ordinals.com.
3. This inscription uses ethersjs ([inscribed](https://ordinals.com/inscription/56694443a06aaf7a6f69862c041bd15a69d858f919a7c62155044d2b46076e69i0)) for a user to connect a Metamask wallet and call EVM smart contract functions within the sandboxed BTC inscription.
