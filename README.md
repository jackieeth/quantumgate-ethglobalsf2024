# Quantum Gate 
Quantum Gate unlocks EVM utilities on BTC Ordinals inscriptions. This is an ETH Global SF Hackathon 2024 project.

## How it works
1. This app is an BTC inscription (to be inscribed soon). This inscription lives on the BTC blockchain.
2. A user visits the inscription page hosted by any BTC Ordinals explorer such as ordinals.com.
3. This inscription uses ethersjs ([inscribed](https://ordinals.com/inscription/10d92ec11b31ea21752ac46781d109bcf53bba04ae9b1044747057335c77ef9ci0)) for a user to connect a Metamask wallet and call EVM smart contract functions within the sandboxed BTC inscription.
